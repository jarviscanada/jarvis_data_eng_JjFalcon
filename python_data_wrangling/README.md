# Introduction
LGS, London Gift Shop is a UK-based online store that sells gift-ware
whose revenue has plateaued for the past 10 years.

They are looking to increase revenue through data-driven marketing strategies
by utilizing the latest technology to gain a better view into
their customersâ€™ motivations, preferences, and behaviors.

This project is a POC development to provide LGS business intelligence
about their sales trend and customer portfolio.

RFM segmentation will also be provided to allow LGS
to target a specific group of customers with marketing efforts that
are highly relevant for their particular behaviour.

# Implementation
This application is implemented in python within the Jupyter Notebook environment
and will utilize the Pandas Dataframe and Matplotlib to provide the relevant business intelligence and charts.

### Project Architecture
LGS currently uses Microsoft Azure Resource Group to house their full-stack application
and uses Azure SQL Server [OLTP] as the DB for day-to-day business.

As a POC we are only provided with a data dump for transactions
between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011 to work on.

This retail.sql file is saved [here](./psql/retail.sql).

This application ran on the Jupyter Notebook environment that accesses   
the file ingested into a PostgreSQL DB via Docker containers.

A docker bridge network connects the two containers.

## Data Analytics and Wrangling
### Data Analytics
The Data Analysis in Jupyter Notebook (found [here](./retail_data_analytics_wrangling.ipynb)) performs data preparation and cleansing, and then presents the following analytics and charts:
1. Monthly Distribution of Regular Orders vs Cancelled Orders
2. Monthly Sales and its Growth Trends
3. Monthly Distribution of Existing vs New Customers
4. RFM Segmentation Analysis

### Business Intelligence
#### Based on Monthly Distribution of Existing vs New Customers
+ While there is a consistent amount of "New Customers" added every month, there is no corresponding growth in "Existing Customer.
  <br/><br/>
+ The fluctuation [increase/decrease] in "Existing Customers" suggests that there is a significant amount of customers "abandoning" the company.

Recommendation:  
Investigate whether customers are being deleted from the DB.  
This should not happen, instead inactive customers should be marked down as inactive.
Then, analyze inactive customers and perform a correlation analysis against products purchased.

#### Based on RFM Segmentation
+ Marketing Strategy 01:  Target Segments:  About to Sleep, At Risk, Hibernating, Need Attention
+ Marketing Strategy 02:  Target Segments:  Can't Lose, Champions, Loyal Customers
+ Marketing Strategy 03:  Target Segments:  New Customers, Possible Loyalists, Promising

Recommendation:
- Marketing Strategy 01:  These are segments who are likely unsatisfied with existing products.
  <br/><br/>
  Reach out and provide incentives in getting feedback on products purchased.
  <br/>
  Introduce any new products and/or product improvements that might get them interested again.
  <br/>
  Introduce free trial periods on new products.
  <br/>

- Marketing Strategy 02:  These are segments who are likely very satisfied with existing products.
  <br/><br/>
  Regularly reach out and provide incentives in being "great" customers.  
  Constant communication is key to ensure they feel valued.
  <br/>
  Introduce occasional discount promotions as a way to say Thank You.
  <br/>
  Introduce loyalty recognition promotions.

- Marketing Strategy 03:  These are segments who are likely exploring existing products.
  <br/><br/>
  Introduce cross-promotions. ie) Introduce additional products related to their first purchase.
  <br/>
  Introduce loyalty programs and provide incentives to sign up.
  <br/>
  Introduce awareness campaigns to get them educated of existing products / product lines.


# Improvements
- Provide Analyses on Customer Churn [based on a certain period of inactivity]
- Provide Analyses on Product Segments
- Provide Correlation Analyses between Products vs Months/Season and/or Customer Demographics
